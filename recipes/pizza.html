    <h1>NO-RISE PIZZA DOUGH</h1>
    <img src ="../images/No-Rise-Pizza-Dough-7.jpg" width="300"/>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A no-rise pizza dough is a quick-fix, 5-to-10-minute, yeast-free or instant-yeast alternative to traditional fermented pizza dough that goes directly from bowl to oven. It is designed for maximum speed and convenience, often relying on baking powder rather than yeast for leavening, which eliminates the need for proofing and resting time</p>
    <p>This quick pizza dough recipe simply involves mixing a few basic ingredients and patting the dough into the pan for a delicious crust — no need to wait for the dough to rise with this recipe!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, sugar, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Mix in warm water and oil until dough comes together.</li>
        <li>To bake the pizza: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees C (190 degrees C). Pat and stretch dough onto a large pizza pan; cover with pizza sauce and top with pepperoni slices and shredded cheese, or desired toppings. Bake in the preheated oven until crust is lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes.
